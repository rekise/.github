# rekise Organization Configuration

This repository serves as the organization-wide configuration for all repositories in the `rekise` organization.

## Organization-Wide Templates

### Issue Templates

This repository provides standardized issue templates that are automatically available across all repositories in the organization:

- **üêõ Bug Report** (`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`) - Structured form for reporting bugs with robotics-specific fields
- **Bug Report (Markdown)** (`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`) - Alternative markdown format
- **Template Configuration** (`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`) - Controls template behavior

### Pull Request Template

The pull request template ([PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)) is automatically applied to all pull requests across the organization's repositories.

The template helps ensure consistent and comprehensive pull request descriptions by prompting contributors to include:

- **Summary**: A clear description of what the PR does
- **Changes**: Detailed list of modifications made
- **Testing**: How the changes were tested
- **Related Issues**: Links to related issues or tickets
- **Screenshots**: Visual documentation when applicable
- **Checklist**: Verification items before merging
- **Additional Notes**: Limitations, follow-ups, or questions for reviewers

## Usage

These templates are automatically inherited by all repositories in the `rekise` organization. Repository-specific templates will override these organization-wide defaults if present.
